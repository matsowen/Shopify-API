**********************************************************************************************************

The Shopify API gem allows Ruby developers to programmatically access the admin section of Shopify stores.

The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE). Each resource, like Order, Product, or Collection, has its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, weâ€™ve tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

## Usage

### Requirements

All API usage happens through Shopify applications, created by either shop owners for their own shops, or by Shopify Partners for use by other shop owners:

* Shop owners can create applications for themselves through their own admin: https://docs.shopify.com/api/authentication/creating-a-private-app
* Shopify Partners create applications through their admin: http://app.shopify.com/services/partners

For more information and detailed documentation about the API visit http://api.shopify.com

#### Ruby version

This gem requires Ruby 2.3.1 as of version 4.3. If you need to use an older Ruby version then update your `Gemfile` to lock onto an older release than 4.3.

### Installation

Add `shopify_api` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'shopify_api'
```

Or install via [gem](http://rubygems.org/)

```bash
gem install shopify_api
```

#### Rails 5

shopify_api is compatible with Rails 5 but since the latest ActiveResource release (4.1) is locked on Rails 4.x, you'll need to use the unreleased master version:

```ruby
gem 'shopify_api'
gem 'activeresource', github: 'rails/activeresource'
```

### Console

This package also supports the ``shopify-cli`` executable to make it easy to open up an interactive console to use the API with a shop.

1. Install the ``shopify_cli`` gem.

```bash
gem install shopify_cli
```

2. Obtain a private API key and password to use with your shop (step 2 in "Getting Started")

3. Use the ``shopify-cli`` script to save the credentials for the shop to quickly log in.

   ```bash
   shopify-cli add yourshopname
   ```

   Follow the prompts for the shop domain, API key and password.

4. Start the console for the connection.

   ```bash
   shopify-cli console
   ```

5. To see the full list of commands, type:

   ```bash
   shopify-cli help
   ```

## Threadsafety

ActiveResource is threadsafe as of version 4.1 (which works with Rails 4.x and above).

If you were previously using Shopify's [activeresource fork](https://github.com/shopify/activeresource) then you should remove it and use ActiveResource 4.1.

## Using Development Version

Download the source code and run:

```bash
rake install
```
